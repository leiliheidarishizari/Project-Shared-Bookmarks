*Shared Bookmarks*

**Project Overview**

Shared Bookmarks is a simple web application that allows users to save their favorite links along with a short description and share them with others. Users can select from a list of predefined users and view their saved bookmarks. Each bookmark includes a title, description, and a hyperlink to the saved URL. The bookmarks are displayed in reverse chronological order.

This project is designed to help developers and users easily record and share useful links without implementing authentication. The web application is hosted online, allowing users to share the web URL with anyone.
